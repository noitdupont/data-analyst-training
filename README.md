> [!NOTE]
> I have started teaching data analysis and might eventually turn it into a digital course. [AGI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) can't and won't automate everything data analysts do. Acquire the skills, make a lot of money, and take care of your family. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
